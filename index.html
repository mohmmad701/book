   Why Learn C#?
C# is one of the most popular programming languages and can be used for a variety of things, including mobile applications, game development, and enterprise software. Knowing C# opens a great deal of doors for you as a developer.

<p class="restof_p">Declaring Arrays

// Declare an array of length 8 without setting the values.
string[] stringArray = new string[8];
 
// Declare array and set its values to 3, 4, 5.
int[] intArray = new int[] { 3, 4, 5 };
A C# array variable is declared similarly to a non-array variable, with the addition of square brackets ([]) after the type specifier to denote it as an array.

The new keyword is needed when instantiating a new array to assign to the variable, as well as the array length in the square brackets. The array can also be instantiated with values using curly braces ({}). In this case the array length is not necessary.
